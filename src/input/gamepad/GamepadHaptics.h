// DualSense/DualShock support (rumble, lightbar, adaptive triggers) is built
// on top of Ohjurot/DualSense-Windows (MIT), vendored in full under
// libs/DualSenseWindows/. Windows exposes no public vendor API for these
// controllers -- XInput doesn't cover them at all -- so this library talks
// to the hardware directly over raw HID (SetupAPI/hid.lib), matching it by
// its USB vendor/product ID. See libs/DualSenseWindows/LICENSE.

	// Plain 0..255 RGB. This module is deliberately SFML-free -- it's meant
	// to be copied wholesale into another project that might not even use

	// project's code does; this is its own minimal stand-in.

	// Cross-controller vibration/lightbar/adaptive-trigger layer, independent
	// of SFML's own joystick polling -- detects an Xbox controller through
	// its native XInput API, or a DualSense/DualShock controller through the
	// vendored DualSenseWindows library (raw HID), and turns high-level
	// "make it rumble"/"set this color"/"resist this trigger" calls into
	// whatever that hardware actually expects.
	//
	// Self-contained: only depends on the Windows SDK and the vendored
	// DualSenseWindows library -- nothing from this project's own game
	// code. Meant to be copyable wholesale into another project.
